# KyrahsMDimArray
Common Tool to contain, process multidimensional matrixes

KyrahsMDimArray provide variety of classes and functions for handling and operating arrays with 2,3,4, and so far on dimensions on a common basis.
Here's some of the features included (or to be included):
1. Creating array with any dimensions you want: DONE!
2. Way to process basic operations: Access any element by its coordinates, and get or set value: DONE!
3. Slicing: Taking a slice of an array (e.g. taking a 2d matrix from 3d array: given an central element coordinates and axises): IN PROGRESS!
4. Aggregate functions(Including a way to process your custom ones!)
5. Each-Element-Functions(Including a way to process your custom ones!)
