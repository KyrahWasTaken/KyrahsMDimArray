# KyrahsMDimArray
Common Tool to contain, process multidimensional matrixes

KyrahsMDimArray provide variety of classes and functions for handling and operating arrays with 2,3,4, and so far on dimensions on a common basis.
Here's some of the features included (or to be included):
1. Creating array with any dimensions you want: DONE!
2. Generics: Elements of any type in your arrays: DONE!
3. Way to process basic operations: Access any element by its coordinates, and get or set value: DONE!
4. Slicing: Taking a slice of an array (e.g. taking a 2d matrix from 3d array: given an central element coordinates and axises): IN PROGRESS!
5. Expanding array in any dimension
6. (Maybe) Expanding array to new dimension
7. Aggregate functions(Including a way to process your custom ones!)
8. Each-Element-Functions(Including a way to process your custom ones!)

GUIDE:

In order to start using this class you have to create an Array object. an instance of array creates with array of integers representing its size in each dimension.

Hope you'll find it a helpful tool in your math and other applications =)
